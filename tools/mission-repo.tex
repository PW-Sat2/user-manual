\section{Mission Repository}

Main database for operations: all uploaded and downloaded data for all past sessions are stored here. It also contains future sessions for next few weeks planned as "auto".

Primary GS will upload the session data after session finished.

Sessions planning is based on pull requests. Session operator creates git branch with updated session data and tasklist file and creates pull request. Other operators review the pull request, and after acceptance the operator merges the branch to master.
