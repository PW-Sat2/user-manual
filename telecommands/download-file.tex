\subsection{Definition}
\TelecommandApid{DownloadFile}
\TelecommandDeclaration{DownloadFileTelecommand}

Parameters: 

\begin{tcarglist}
	\tcarg{correlation\_id}{8}{Correlation ID}
	\tcarg{path}{variable}{Path to the file on the satellite's filesystem}
	\tcarg{seqs}{variable}{32-bit LE sequence numbers of parts that will be send}
\end{tcarglist}

\subsection{Responses}

\paragraph{CorrelatedDownlinkFrame}
\ResponseApid{CorrelatedDownlinkFrame}

This telecommand always responds with \texttt{CorrelatedDownlinkFrame}.

The first byte indicates success or error code.

\begin{tabular}{r | l}
	Code & Description \\ \hline
	0 		& Success \\
	1 		& File not found \\
	2 		& Malformed request \\
	3 		& Path is invalid \\
	4 		& Sequence is too big
\end{tabular}

For \texttt{Success} the response follows with \texttt{requested\_fragments} amount of the corresponding file segment bytes.

For \texttt{File not found} and \texttt{Sequence is too big} error codes the response follows with received file path without the terminating zero.

For \texttt{Malformed request} and \texttt{Path is invalid} error codes the response doesn't contain any additional data.

\subsection{Example usage}
Download 1, 10, 65536 fragments (\texttt{seqs=1,10,65536}) from picture.jpg file (\texttt{path=/picture.jpg}) \texttt{correlation\_id=11}.

\exampleCall{DownloadFileTelecommand(11, "/picture.jpg", [1,10,65536])}

When \texttt{CorrelatedDownlinkFrame} is received it should contain 3 bytes from the picture.jpg file.
