\telecommand{SetAntennaDeploymentMask}

\tccategory{D}

\subsection{General description}
\texttt{SetAntennaDeploymentMask} telecommand is capable of enabling/disabling \nameref{obc:proc:Antenna Deployment Process}.

Deployment disabled flag is set immediately in \nameref{obc:proc:Persistent State} and prevents any further deployment steps from executing. Deployment is not resumed after \OBC restart.

\paragraph{Known issues}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Aborting deployment while it's already in progress can leave satellite in undetermined state (e.g.\ enabled LCLs)
	\item Deployment process will be \textbf{resumed} (not restarted from step 0) if enabled again without \OBC restart
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Side effects}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Antenna deployment is stopped
	\item On next \OBC boot process will not be started
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Usage limitations} 
\begin{itemize}
	\item Disable deployment process only if antennas are deployed correctly. 
	\item Total burn time for ANT resistors is limited (300s, 100 burn cycles)
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Recommendations for operation team} 
\begin{itemize}
	\item Disable deployment process as soon as stable communication is established to decrease power usage
	\item Download telemetry gathered during deployment process to verify ANT module status
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Definition}
\TelecommandApid{SetAntennaDeployment}
\TelecommandDeclaration{SetAntennaDeployment}

Parameters:

\begin{tcarglist}
	\tcarg{correlation\_id}{8}{Correlation ID}
	\tcarg{deployment disabled}{boolean}{0 - deployment enabled, non-zero - deployment disabled}
\end{tcarglist}

\subsection{Responses}

\responseFrame{StopAntennaDeploymentSuccessFrame}
\ResponseApid{StopAntennaDeploymentSuccessFrame}

Correlated success response frame is of type \texttt{StopAntennaDeploymentSuccessFrame} and contains single byte with value 0. If this frame is sent, change of deployment flag was successfully saved in \nameref{obc:proc:Persistent State}.

\responseFrame{StopAntennaDeploymentErrorFrame}
\ResponseApid{StopAntennaDeploymentErrorFrame}

Correlated error response frame type type is \texttt{StopAntennaDeploymentErrorFrame} and contains error code:

\begin{tabular}{r | l}
    Error code & Value \\
    \hline
    -1 & Malformed request (i.e. missing parameters) \\
    -2 & Unable to disable antenna deployment - cannot set persistent state
\end{tabular}

\subsection{Example usage}
Disable antenna deployment process, respond with correlation ID 12
\exampleCall{SetAntennaDeployment(12, 1)}
