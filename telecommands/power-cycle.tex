\section{Power cycle}

\tccategory{PD}

\subsection{General description}
\texttt{PowerCycle} performs full satellite power cycle using EPS. Power cycle attempts will performed according to \nameref{obcproc:powercycle} procedure. Just before performing power cycle success frame is sent to acknowledge receipt of telecommand. It \textbf{does not} indicate that power cycle was successful.

Figure \ref{fig:tc:powercycle} shows flow of power cycle telecommand. If power cycle was successful processing will be stopped after issuing \texttt{PowerCycle()}.

\paragraph{Known issues}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Confirmation response frame might not be sent if power cycle will be faster than COMM module
	\item It is not possible to force usage of specific EPS controller to perform power cycle. If control over used EPS controller is required, RawI2CTelecommand should be used.\todo{Describe RawI2CTelecommand}
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Side effects}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Satellite is power cycled. 
	\item No communication in the next few minutes.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Usage limitations}
\None

\paragraph{Recommendations for operation team}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Plan regular power cycles
	\item Perform power cycles during long sessions to be able to verify that satellite is back in operational state
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Responses}

\paragraph{PowerSuccessFrame}
\ResponseApid{PowerSuccessFrame}
Correlated response frame \texttt{PowerSuccessFrame} confirms that telecommand was received and Power Cycle will be performed. It DOES NOT mean that power cycle was successful. No extra payload is carried in this response frame.

\paragraph{PowerErrorFrame}
\ResponseApid{PowerErrorFrame}
Correlated response frame \texttt{PowerErrorFrame} represents error. Error code indicates failure reason:
\begin{description}
	\item[\texttt{0x01}] Malformed (too short) telecommand
	\item[\texttt{0x02}] Power cycle error (\OBC execution was not terminated after issuing power cycle command)
\end{description}

\subsection{Definition}
\TelecommandApid{PowerCycleTelecommand}
\ctor{PowerCycleTelecommand}

Arguments: 
\begin{description}[labelindent=1cm]
	\item[\texttt{correlation\_id}] - Correlation ID (8-bit number)
\end{description}

\subsection{Example usage}
Perform power cycle, correlation ID = 11
