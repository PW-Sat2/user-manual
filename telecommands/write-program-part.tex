\telecommand{WriteProgramPart}

\tccategory{D}

\subsection{General description}
\texttt{WriteProgramPart} writes part of program into selected boot slots as step in \nameref{obc:proc:Program upload} procedure.


\paragraph{Known issues}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Failure to write to single boot slots aborts procedure
	\item Writing part in long (up to a minute) operation
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Side effects}\mbox{}\\ \None

\paragraph{Usage limitations}
\begin{itemize}
	\item This telecommand must be used exactly as described in \nameref{obc:proc:Program upload} procedure.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Recommendations for operation team}
Refer to \nameref{obc:proc:Program upload} procedure for details on uploading new software version.


\subsection{Definition}
\TelecommandApid{WriteProgramPart}
\TelecommandDeclaration{WriteProgramPart}

Parameters: 

\begin{tcarglist}
	\tcarg{entries}{8}{Bitmask indicating boot slots program part will be written to}
	\tcarg{offset}{32}{Offset in bytes from boot slot start where part should be written}
	\tcarg{content}{(variable)}{Byte list that will be written}
\end{tcarglist}


\subsection{Responses}

\paragraph{EntryProgramPartWriteSuccess}
\ResponseApid{EntryProgramPartWriteSuccess}
Response frame \texttt{EntryProgramPartWriteSuccess} indicates successful write of program parts. It carries additional values:

\begin{tabular}{r | r | l}
	Field & Size [bits] & Value \\
	\hline
	\texttt{entries} & 8 & Bitmask indicating boot slots program part was written to \\	
	\texttt{offset} & 32 & Offset in bytes from boot slot start where part was written \\
	\texttt{size} & 8 & Size of written part (should match length of \texttt{content} parameter) \\
\end{tabular}

\paragraph{EntryProgramPartWriteError} \mbox{} \\
%\ResponseApid{EntryProgramPartWriteError}
\todo{Add EntryProgramPartWriteError to OBC response frames} \\
Response frame \texttt{EntryProgramPartWriteError} indicates failure of writing program part. Carried error code indicates reason:

\begin{tabular}{r | l}
	Error code & Value \\
	\hline
	\texttt{1} & Malformed telecommand (no further information available) \\	
	\texttt{\textit{FlashStatus}} & Program flash has reported error. Referer to \texttt{FlashStatus} for exact meaning \\	
\end{tabular}

Beside error code additional fields are contained within this response frame:

\begin{tabular}{r | r | l}
	Field & Size [bits] & Value \\
	\hline
	\texttt{entry} & 8 & Bitmask indicating boot slot in which error occured \\	
	\texttt{offset} & 32 & Offset at which error occured \\
\end{tabular}


\subsection{Example usage}
Write bytes \texttt{0xDE, 0xAD, 0xBE, 0xEF} at addresses \texttt{0x100, 0x101, 0x102, 0x103} in boot slots 3,4,5.
