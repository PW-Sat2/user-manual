\telecommand{Set Adcs Mode}

\tccategory{D}

\subsection{General description}
\texttt{Set \Adcs Mode} telecommand sets new \Adcs subystem operating mode. Practically it can either set 
the Builtin Detumbling (which will turn on the \Imtq module) or disable the \Adcs completely. If \Adcs is 
disabled/stopped the \Adcs subsystem (\Imtq) will be powered off. Enabling the detumbling will power on the \Imtq.

\paragraph{Known issues}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \danger \texttt{ExperimentalDetumbling} mode's tests have shown that it is unstable. \\
    \textbf{DO NOT TURN ON} experimental detumbling! It's harmful to satellite's power budget and may cause an overheat, tumbling and power loss! 
    \item \danger \texttt{ExperimentalSunpointing} mode has not been implemented.  \\
    \textbf{DO NOT TURN ON} \Adcs experimental sun pointing!
    \item \warn \Adcs has two "inactive" modes: \texttt{Stopped} and \texttt{Disabled}. There's almost no difference in effects, both will cause \Imtq to be powered off. However, if satellite is in \texttt{Disabled} mode, then it must first be set to \texttt{Stopped} before enabling detumbling.

\subsection{Definition}
\TelecommandApid{SetAdcsModeTelecommand}
\TelecommandDeclaration{SetAdcsModeTelecommand}

Parameters: 

\begin{tcarglist}	
	\tcarg{correlation\_id}{8}{Correlation ID}
	\tcarg{mode}{8}{Desired \Adcs mode (see table below)}
\end{tcarglist}

Values for \texttt{mode} argument:

\begin{tabular}{r | l}
    Mode & \texttt{mode} value \\
    \hline
    Disabled & -2 \\
    Stopped & -1 \\
    BuiltinDetumbling & 0 \\
    ExperimentalDetumbling & 1 \\
    ExperimentalSunpointing & 2 \\
\end{tabular}


\subsection{Responses}

\paragraph{SetAdcsModeSuccessFrame}
\ResponseApid{SetAdcsModeSuccessFrame}
Correlated response frame \texttt{SetAdcsModeSuccessFrame} confirms that 
telecommand was received and requested \Adcs mode was scheduled. 
It DOES NOT mean that setting the mode was successful. This response can be 
distinguished from \texttt{SetAdcsModeErrorFrame} because the byte after 
correlation id is set to 0. 

\paragraph{SetAdcsModeErrorFrame}
\ResponseApid{SetAdcsModeErrorFrame}
Correlated response frame \texttt{SetAdcsModeErrorFrame} represents error. 
This response can be distinguished from \texttt{SetAdcsModeSuccessFrame} 
because the byte after correlation id is set to 1. There's no additional 
information about error, the likely causes are invalid request frame or 
failure to schedule \Adcs mode.

\subsection{Example usage}
Enable built-in detumbling, correlation ID = 11.

\exampleCall{SetAdcsModeTelecommand(11, 0)}

Turn \Adcs off, correlation ID = 12.

\exampleCall{SetAdcsModeTelecommand(12,-1)}
