\todo{Describe time correction}

The time correction is calculated using weighted sum from two deltas (based on measuring time from two sources):

$\correctionValue = \frac{\wMcu \deltaMcu + \wRtc \deltaRtc}{\wMcu + \wRtc}$

where:

\begin{tabular}{r | l}
	Symbol & Meaning \\
	\hline
	$\deltaMcu$ & time change according to microcontroller clock \\ 
	$\deltaRtc$ & time change according to external real time clock \\
	\label{sec:time-wMcu} $\wMcu$ & weight for $\deltaMcu$ \\
	\label{sec:time-wRtc} $\wRtc$ & weight for $\deltaRtc$ \\
\end{tabular}

The maximum allowed value for $\correctionValue$ is 2 hours. If the $\correctionValue > 2 h$ then the correction is abandoned and current time is assumed to be time indicated by microcontroller clock.
