\obcproc{Sail Deployment Process}

This process is responsible for reliable sail deployment. This process once started will be restarted from the 
beginning in case of the \obc restart. The once started sail deployment process can be stopped by using \tcref{Stop Sail Deployment} telecommand. 
The sail deployment status is recorded in the \procref{Persistent State} as follows:

\begin{longtable}{l|l|l|M{1cm}|M{1.5cm}}
    \toprule
    \textbf{Group} & \textbf{Variable} & \textbf{Description} & \textbf{Size [bits]} & \textbf{Default Value} \\
    \midrule
    \endhead
    SailState & currentState & \parbox[c]{10cm}{
        The Sail opening state which is encoded as follows: \\
        \begin{tabular}{c|l|m{6.5cm}}
            \textbf{Value} & \textbf{Name} & \textbf{Description} \\
            \hline
            0 & Waiting & Sail deployment has not yet been started \\
            1 & Opening & Sail is being deployed \\
            2 & Stopped & Sail deployment either has been completed or has been stopped by the \tcref{Stop Sail Deployment} telecommand. \\
        \end{tabular}} & 8 & 0 \\
    \bottomrule
\end{longtable}

This process is triggered by a number of possible events:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Passage of time - sail deployment is automatically performed at the beginning of the 41st day of the mission,
    \item \tcref{Open Sail} telecommand,
    \item \tcref{Perform Sail Experiment} telecommand,
    \item In case of permanent \obc failure. Once the \eps subsystem loses contact with \obc for more than 
    32 hours it begins emergency sail deployment.
    \item as a result of negative power budged (i.e. when satellite is spinning too fast) which will cause that 
    single \obc session will be shorter than 30 minutes then sail deployment will be triggered after no more than several hours.
\end{itemize}

\danger{The sail deployment has a very significant negative impact on the satellite as a whole and mission: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item The deployment itself will cause very fast satellite spinning (${\sim}200$ deg/s),
	\item It is almost certain that communication will not be possible after sail deployment due to both satellite spinning
	and the fact that sail itself significantly affects RF antenna characteristics,
    \item Power budget will become negative due to the very fast satellite rotation. Full battery depletion is expected in 1.5 days since sail deployment.
\end{itemize}
