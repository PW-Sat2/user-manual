Ground stations expose uplink and downlink functionality through API based on ZeroMQ messages (https://zeromq.org/) through TCP transport. The TCP endpoints are not exposed to public network, so in order to work with them, the Client must be connected to the same network.

All data exchanged between ground and PW-Sat2 are AX.25 KISS-encoded frames.  Consult AX.25 (http://www.ax25.net/AX25.2.2-Jul\%2098-2.pdf) and APRS (http://www.aprs.org/doc/APRS101.PDF) documentation.

Summary of available endpoints:
\begin{longtable}{l|l}
    \toprule
    \textbf{Function} & \textbf{Endpoint} \\
    \midrule
    \endhead
    Receive downlink frames & \texttt{tcp://<host>:7001} \\
    Transmit uplink frame & \texttt{tcp://<host>:7000} \\
    \bottomrule
\end{longtable}

PW-Sat2 maintains an open-source repository, containing among others, a Python code used to decode and encode PW-Sat2 data. The relevant parts are located in GitHub repository: https://github.com/PW-Sat2/PWSat2OBC/tree/master/integration_tests.
